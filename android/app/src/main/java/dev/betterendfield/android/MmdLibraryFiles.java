/**
 * The bounds and primitives a work import is built from.
 *
 * An import copies files out of a document tree the user granted access to, and
 * every one of those files is attacker-influenced in the only sense that
 * matters here: it comes from outside this process. So the sizes, the entry
 * count, the nesting depth and the shape of every path are all checked before a
 * byte is written, and the checks live in one place so the tree walk, the loose
 * slot import and the installer cannot drift apart.
 *
 * There is deliberately no archive support: ZIP and 7z would need an extraction
 * library this app does not otherwise carry, and a work that arrives as an
 * archive has to be unpacked outside the app anyway. A directory tree is the
 * form the library is defined in, and it is the form this checks.
