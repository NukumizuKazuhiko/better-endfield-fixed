/**
 * Panel-to-runtime channel. This used to be a JNI bridge, but the runtime
 * library registers under the game's classloader while these classes belong to
 * the LSPosed module classloader — and Android scopes JNI symbol lookup (and
 * .so openings) per classloader, so every call threw UnsatisfiedLinkError while
 * the native modules themselves ran fine. Plain files in the game's own files
 * directory have no such boundary: the native side (input_relay.cpp) tails the
 * input file and publishes the status file.
 *
 * Protocol, one event per line:
 *   "&lt;vk&gt; &lt;action&gt;\n"  latch a virtual key
 *   "c &lt;payload&gt;\n"       submit a runtime command
 *   "r\n"               release every latched key
 *   "m &lt;dx&gt; &lt;dy&gt;\n"     accumulate a mouse-look delta
 *   "p &lt;dx&gt; &lt;dy&gt;\n"     accumulate a PC-layout relative mouse delta
 *   "P &lt;0|1&gt;\n"         report platform pointer capture for the PC layout
