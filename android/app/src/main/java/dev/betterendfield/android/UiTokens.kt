/**
 * The single source of truth for the app's look.
 *
 * The direction is industrial: near-black ground, one white text ramp for
 * hierarchy, and a single yellow that is spent only on the primary action, the
 * current selection and the few states worth interrupting for. There is no
 * second hue anywhere - a green or teal reference would break the palette's
 * discipline even when it is only used for a success message.
 *
 * Layers step by fill rather than by outline, so the elevation ramp is the
 * information architecture: page, then panel, then row, then field. The four
 * steps are deliberately close together, because a large luminance jump between
 * a card and the row inside it reads as a rendering error rather than a
 * hierarchy.
 *
 * Text contrast is chosen so body text on [Colors.panel] and ink text on a
 * filled [Colors.accent] button both clear the 7:1 target; that is what keeps a
 * borderless layout legible instead of merely sparse.
 *
 * The mix is held to roughly 76% black/grey, 18% white/grey text and 6% yellow.
 * Anything that would raise the yellow above a sixth of the surface belongs in
 * the neutral ramp instead.
