/**
 * Reads the device gyroscope in the <em>game</em> process and turns it into the
 * same screen-space look deltas the panel's look pad already produces.
 *
 * <h3>Why it lives here and not in the settings app</h3>
 * A {@code SensorEvent} is delivered to whichever process registered the
 * listener, and the deltas have to reach the native camera module — which only
 * exists inside the game process. A settings-app listener would need a second
 * cross-process channel for a stream that is useless to the settings app
 * itself. Registering here costs nothing: the relay that carries the panel's
 * drags is already open, and {@link NativeCommandBridge#look} writes exactly the
 * line this needs.
 *
 * <h3>Why it feeds the mouse-look channel instead of a camera controller</h3>
 * This module does not own the first-person camera's orientation: the game
 * produces it and {@code ApplyFirstPersonState} deliberately preserves it. The
 * only way a gyroscope can steer that camera without forking the game's look
 * state — which would desynchronise the reticle, the body-follow and every
 * limit the game applies — is to arrive as the same input a finger produces.
 * The deltas below are in the units the free camera's mouse term expects (screen
 * pixels, x right, y down), so the same path serves both.
 *
 * <h3>Integration uses the sensor clock, not the frame clock</h3>
 * The sensor runs near 200 Hz while the game renders at 60–120 FPS, so a frame
 * sees three or four samples. Integrating against a frame delta would both lose
 * the samples between reads and scale the response with the frame rate. Each
 * sample is therefore integrated against {@link SensorEvent#timestamp}, and only
 * the sum is handed on.
