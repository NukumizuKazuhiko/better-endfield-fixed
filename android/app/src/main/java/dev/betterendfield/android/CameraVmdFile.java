/**
 * Materializes the imported VMD camera motion where the native module can open
 * it.
 *
 * The settings app publishes the .vmd into the framework's remote file space,
 * which is reachable through the LSPosed service and not as a path - and the
 * native loader takes a path ({@code LoadVmdCamera} hands it straight to
 * {@code CreateFileW}, which on Android is a plain {@code open()}). So the game
 * process copies it once into its own files directory, and the configuration
 * points there through {@link ModuleSettings#VMD_FILE_SLOT}.
 *
 * The copy is skipped when the target already has exactly the published length:
 * that length is stamped by the settings app, so a match means this is already
 * the current file. Re-copying on every launch would be pure start-up cost, and
 * a .vmd is small but not free.
