/**
 * Copies the imported MMD files where the native director can open them.
 *
 * The settings app publishes each slot into the framework's remote file space,
 * which is reachable through the LSPosed service and not as a path - and the
 * native loader takes a path, because {@code LoadVmdCamera} hands it straight to
 * {@code CreateFileW}, which on Android is a plain {@code open()}. So the game
 * process copies each slot once into its own files directory, from where the
 * camera configuration points at it through {@code %files%}.
 *
 * A copy is skipped when the target already has exactly the declared length.
 * That length is stamped by the settings app at import time, so a match means
 * this is already the current file; re-copying on every launch would be pure
 * start-up cost.
 *
 * The directory is shared with the library form of MMD - a work folder under
 * {@code BETTER_ENDFIELD_MMD_ROOT} is one level below it - so pruning only ever
 * removes loose files, never a directory.

     * Materializes the installed library works beside the loose slots.

     * A work is several files in a folder of its own, so it is copied as a unit
     * and published as a unit: the files go into a staging directory, and the
     * directory is renamed into place only when every file is present at its
     * declared length. The game scans the library for folders with a
     * {@code set.ini}, so a staging name is simply not a work - an interrupted
     * copy is invisible rather than half-playable, which is also why the visible
     * folder is dropped before the rename instead of being merged into.
     *
     * The declared length is checked in both directions. It is what the settings
     * app stamped when it published the file, so a short copy means the remote
     * space lost bytes or the publish never finished - either way the work must
     * not be advertised, because the alternative is the game failing to parse a
     * file for reasons it cannot report.
     *
     * Anything left under a UUID name that the index no longer lists is a work
     * the user removed, and it is deleted here rather than in the settings app:
     * the settings app cannot reach this directory at all, which is the same
     * reason the bytes had to travel through the framework in the first place.
