# Better Endfield

[English](README.en.md) | [简体中文](README.md)

Better Endfield is a modular modding runtime for *Arknights: Endfield*. Features such as custom character appearances (BEM), title screen models & choreography, per-character voice language routing, OmniMix dynamic music replacement, real-time combat stats & rDPS metering, display enhancement (OptiScaler DLSS/FSR/XeSS) and mobile touch HUD emulation are provided as decoupled native DLL modules. The core Host handles dynamic IL2CPP runtime symbol resolution, Hook lifecycle management, configuration persistence, and module discovery.

The Windows desktop build and the Android/LSPosed build share one set of module sources. As of 3.3.0, custom character appearances use the same standard BEM package on both platforms. See [Android (LSPosed)](#android-lsposed) for the attach model, the in-game control panel and the diagnostics channel.

## Upstream & Project Origin

This project is derived from [Dr-hydra/Better-Endfield](https://github.com/Dr-hydra/Better-Endfield) (the upstream project). It is **independently maintained and is not an official version of the upstream project, and does not represent the upstream author**. The upstream code, documentation and design remain the work of their original authors; this repository continues to be released under AGPL-3.0-only, with the full license text in [LICENSE](LICENSE) and the upstream and third-party attributions recorded in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

This repository carries independent modifications relative to upstream 3.3.0 (commit `9b1e895`), concentrated on the Android/LSPosed port and its documentation; the details are in the 3.3.20 entry of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). The upstream commit history is preserved in full so that code provenance — and the original authors' attribution — stays traceable. Upstream changes may still be selectively incorporated when appropriate, but continuous upstream contribution is not the goal.

## Key Features

1. **Custom Character Appearances (BEM)**: Import `.bem` packages to replace in-game character appearances. One standard package works on both Windows and Android. See [Custom Character Appearances](#custom-character-appearances-bem).
2. **Title Screen Customization**: Replace the default title screen character with any operator, select custom animations/poses, tweak camera angles, and apply custom theme accent colors.
3. **Voice Language Routing**: Assign custom voice languages (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean) individually for each character in both combat and story dialogue.
4. **OmniMix Audio Engine**: Dynamically replace in-game music with custom audio sources via OmniMix.
5. **Real-Time Combat Stats Overlay**: High-performance DirectX in-game HUD displaying damage metering, team rDPS contribution, hit counts, crits, and skill breakdown.
6. **Display & Pipeline (OptiScaler)**: Upscaling with DLSS, FSR, or XeSS, frame generation, sharpness control, and free camera adjustments.
7. **Mobile Touch Emulation**: Experience the mobile touch UI on PC with mouse-to-touch conversion (`Ctrl+Alt+T`) and HUD toggling.
8. **Gacha Record Lookup**: Query and locally aggregate gacha history.
9. **Bilingual Localization**: Built-in support for both English (US) and Simplified Chinese with instant, runtime language switching.

## Custom Character Appearances (BEM)

Custom appearances are disabled by default. The release extension is `.bem`; one package targets one character and may carry several fixed appearances. Players only import the package - no Python, no source mod injection framework, no character database, and no hand-written `runtime.ini`.

Since 3.3.0 this works on both Windows and Android using **the same standard BEMv1 package**. Android compiles the desktop `native/modules/custom_model` sources directly, so there is no second implementation and no game offsets are introduced; parsing and validation follow the same path on both platforms.

On desktop, packages and their state live in the configuration directory. The distribution ships no appearance assets:

```text
%LocalAppData%\BetterEndfield\catalog\custom-model\
  runtime.ini
  packages\*.bem
```

`runtime.ini` is written by the Character Appearance page and is read-only at runtime:

```ini
[CustomModel]
standalone_lod=false

[Mod.<package_id>]
enabled=true
package=packages/<file>.bem
appearance=<appearance_id>
```

Only one package per character may be enabled at a time; duplicates are disabled in the UI with a prompt to reselect. Package and appearance choices take effect on the next game launch, so import, update and delete with the game closed. Updates reuse the same `package_id`, preserving the local enabled state and any appearance IDs that still exist; removed appearances fall back to the default with a notice. Enabling any package locks LOD at runtime; disabling all of them restores the standalone LOD preference.

The conversion tool reads unpacked directories as well as ZIP, RAR and 7z source packages directly, without pre-extraction or a separate archiver, and never runs programs contained in them. It matches source asset identity against the character profiles shipped with the tool, checking index counts, vertex streams, bones and materials; export is offered only after the full check passes. Unsupported sources produce a report explaining what is missing.

Capability boundaries: component replace/keep/hide, separate bone and material sources, merged bone palettes, per-draw game materials, replacement of explicitly bound native textures, and UInt16/UInt32 geometry indices. Limits are 256 local bones and 256 draws per part, and 32 texture bindings plus a 512 MiB upload budget per selected appearance; exceeding them fails with a report. Source hotkey scripts and arbitrary shaders are not executed, and runtime form switching, blend shapes, automatic LOD generation and automatic splitting are not supported. A successful conversion is not in-game verification.

Android manages the same packages from its own third-party model page, validating every appearance on import and preserving the original package bytes. The one platform difference is textures: mobile GPUs use different texture formats, so a package that looks wrong in game can be run through the mobile texture conversion on its management card. A successful conversion publishes a new generation while preserving the enabled state and selected appearance; failure or cancellation leaves the active package untouched. Packages without verified normal-map encoding metadata can still be imported, but cannot be converted. Both platforms require a game restart after changing packages or appearances.

For the authoring workflow, conversion automation boundaries and the full field reference see [`docs/BEM_CREATOR_GUIDE.md`](docs/BEM_CREATOR_GUIDE.md) and [`docs/BEM_V1_SPEC.md`](docs/BEM_V1_SPEC.md).

## Loader Modes

1. **Injector Mode (Recommended)**:
   - Starts the game from the Better Endfield controller or command line.
   - Zero files written to the game directory.
2. **XInput Autostart Mode**:
   - Deploys `xinput1_4.dll` to the game folder for automatic loading when launching the game via official launchers or desktop shortcuts.
   - Clean uninstall supported directly from the Settings page.

## Android (LSPosed)

The Android build compiles the same module sources (`android/`) and attaches to the game process through LSPosed. The companion app provides the model, third-party model, voice, display-enhancement and diagnostics pages, and the game hosts a floating control panel; package management and mobile texture conversion are covered in [Custom Character Appearances](#custom-character-appearances-bem) above. Both the companion app and the BEM package manager are written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, in an industrial flat palette of one page tone, one panel tone and one accent (`#F4E900`, industrial yellow): no outlines, no gradients. Bottom tabs on phones and a fixed side rail at 720 dp and above are two arrangements of a single composition. The experimental `3.3.22-alpha.1` release also uses Compose for the in-game handle and panel, with a framework View host to survive the game rebuilding its content view. A PJX110 cold-launch test showed the handle on the startup screen; gameplay interaction remains unverified. The earlier 3.3.21 Compose attempt crashed; see the [experiment record](docs/ANDROID_OVERLAY_COMPOSE_EXPERIMENT_20260929.md).

The module attaches to whichever app is selected in the LSPosed scope (main process only), and decides whether to act on evidence: `UnityPlayer.nativeRender` must exist, and every native hook resolves by name from `libil2cpp.so` exports, so the official, international and channel builds share one APK. Three platform differences are handled explicitly: the JNI bridge self-heals a classloader mismatch, and a second copy of the module library only serves JNI symbols instead of installing hooks twice; enum constants go through `System.Enum.Parse` managed reflection rather than the boxing path that fails on some clients; static fields are read straight from their storage, and each value is judged on its own so a shared success flag cannot veto a healthy read.

The in-game panel turns the desktop hotkeys into tappable buttons: hide/restore HUD, free camera, world pause, first person, plus the movement pad and a roll/keyframe group under free camera (motion play/stop, view reset, FOV in/out, roll, keyframe record/play/clear). Key presses do not travel over JNI: the module library is loaded by the game's classloader while the panel's bridge classes belong to the LSPosed module classloader, and Android forbids opening the same `.so` path twice under different classloaders. Keys, runtime commands and status therefore go through plain files in the game's own directory, polled natively.

The current development build temporarily returns the camera to the game during an ultimate cast, a cinematic, or a non-level camera view. First person stays armed and resumes when the level camera returns. Offline tests and Android compilation passed. The user reports that the ultimate and character-screen handoffs and returns passed on a device; logs and screenshots have not been supplied for independent review.

First-person head hiding now also detects head-attached accessories whose renderer names do not mention the head or hair. It uses the existing head-hiding setting and restores the renderer's shadow mode on exit. Mixed head/body bone palettes are kept visible. Offline tests and Android compilation passed; individual character outfits still need in-game acceptance.

Thawing the world now rides the engine's own per-frame callback. Freezing it stops the game's camera update, and the module used to queue its hotkey requests only onto game-side callbacks, so the request stayed queued and the world could never be resumed. The same pump now also runs on `UnityEngine.Rendering.RenderPipelineManager.DoRenderLoop_Internal`, which the engine calls for every rendered frame, so resuming no longer depends on the game still running its own camera logic. If a request goes undrained for more than 1.5 s the input thread says so in the log, which turns "the button did nothing" into a readable condition; the log also names the pump that finally drained each request.

The bottom of the panel shows the current process's runtime log (a 150-line ring buffer) and offers "save log to file": a system file picker writes to a location the user chooses, no storage permission required, degrading to a text share when no picker is available. The companion app's diagnostics page reads the same log. If the runtime-log section is missing from the panel entirely, the game is still running an older module build - re-toggle the module in LSPosed or reboot the game.

Free-camera extensions default to no mouse-look hook on mobile (there is no cursor to hook), and the camera configuration uses `schema_version=3` with explicit key names, pinning the panel buttons to the codes the desktop module polls. As of 3.3.22-alpha.5 the motion presets, keyframes and VMD-camera parameters are written into that configuration too, and are editable under Experience -> Motion & Lens. They are clamped to the same limits the native module clamps them to, non-finite values fall back to the defaults, and a preset name is normalised to the spellings `ParseMotionPreset` accepts. As of 3.3.22-alpha.6 that sub-page also imports `.vmd` lens files: the settings app validates the file against the native loader's own rules - its 64 MiB ceiling and its two header generations - publishes it through the framework's remote file space, and the game process copies it into its own data directory before the native library loads, at which point the `%files%` placeholder in the configuration expands to an absolute path. The two processes run under different UIDs, so the settings app can neither read nor write the game's data directory and the path can only be assembled by the game process itself. As of 3.3.22-alpha.7 the panel's three playback keys - motion preset, keyframe replay and VMD replay - do not fire on the tap: pressing one collapses the panel and the key goes out a second later, because the panel covers about a third of the screen and the finger is still on the glass when the tap lands, so an immediate start would begin the shot with the controls in frame. The handle fades out with the panel for the same reason - it is drawn over the game - leaving no overlay element on screen at all. It then comes back on its own: the native module reporting that the take has ended (finished, switched, stopped or left the free camera) fades it back in while the panel stays collapsed, and so does the native module staying silent for three seconds after the key goes out, which is what covers a preset asked for outside the free camera, a keyframe list with fewer than two entries and a VMD that failed to load - those paths return without logging a line, and without that fallback the overlay would never come back. A volume key is then the way to interrupt: it drops a key that has not fired yet, or stops the playback the native module reports as running (the three playback hotkeys are toggles, so stopping re-sends the key that started it) and brings the handle back. That matters because a motion preset, a keyframe loop and a VMD loop can all run forever, and a take that never ends never reports an end. Whether a take is running is read from the native module's own journal - a started line when one begins, a stopped line when it ends for any reason - so a key whose take never started is never "stopped", and a finished take is never restarted. Volume keys are relayed by hooking `Activity.dispatchKeyEvent` and are never consumed: the phone's volume still changes. Every other control still acts on the tap. As of 3.3.22-alpha.8 mobile has steering input: the panel grew a look pad - press and drag to aim, right to turn right and up to tilt up - and Experience -> Motion & Lens carries its sensitivity and Y-invert. The chain is drag deltas -> an `m dx dy` relay line -> the compat layer's accumulator -> folded into `g_mouse_dx/g_mouse_dy` by the camera module on every tick, with no change to the shared desktop source, so sensitivity, inversion, the pitch clamp and ignoring look input during a playback are all the original desktop code paths; Windows behaviour is unchanged. Before that `g_mouse_dx/dy` was always 0 on Android because the mouse hook is compiled only for Windows, so the free camera could move, rise, roll and zoom but not turn. As of 3.3.22-alpha.9 a camera parameter change takes effect at once, with no game restart: the whole camera configuration is delivered to the game process through the framework's remote file space and replayed by the native module through the same entry point it uses at start-up, which already writes every key as one idempotent block and already knows the two transitions that assignment cannot express - the free camera and the first-person camera being switched off. The one exception is the first time the camera is switched on: whether a given launch loads the camera module is decided by the configuration that launch started with, so the very first enable still needs a restart, while everything afterwards in the same session is live. Importing a `.vmd` is live too: the game process copies it into its own data directory before applying the configuration that names it, and if the copy cannot be made the configuration is held back in favour of the previous working one, with a line in the panel journal saying so. Switches unrelated to the camera - hide UID/HUD, sustained dash, the voice catalog, model replacement - are unaffected and still act at start-up.

First-person part hiding has two paths: parts with a complete readback contract can use the GPU mesh patch; parts it cannot reach (non-skinned renderers, unavailable contracts, or exhausted patch attempts) switch to a shadow-casting-only renderer mode, hiding the part from cameras while keeping its shadow. That property is read and written through metadata contracts because Android's engine icall table is only partially implemented; failed mesh-patch initialization does not block this fallback. The current Windows client lacks managed methods required by the synchronous readback path, so S4/S5 mesh behavior remains pending. The game can reset renderer state on part or LOD rebuilds, so the module re-asserts it.

The experimental Android branch is currently 3.3.22-alpha.9 (versionCode 30322, prerelease) while desktop remains 3.3.0; the two version numbers are not yet unified.

For platform internals, contract evidence and the desktop-hotkey-to-panel-button mapping see [`android/README.md`](android/README.md).

Android debug APKs are built by `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` on GitHub Actions for pushes and pull requests, uploaded as the `better-endfield-debug-apk` artifact. The environment is JDK 21, `platforms;android-37.0`, build-tools 36.0.0, NDK 27.2.12479018 and CMake 3.22.1; the Dobby v1.0.5 source is fetched before the build (that dependency is not committed) with its `example/` subdirectory removed, since it needs `DobbyInstrument` / `DobbySymbolResolver`, which Better Endfield disables.

Android 3.3.22 exposes eye position, near clip, extended vertical look, movement facing, animation, dialogue and combat camera yield, transition duration, and an explicit external-model head-scale option. New behaviors default to off. Android settings are loaded at game start, so fully stop and restart the game after saving. The head-scale option removes the head shadow. The user reports that the operable first-person features passed on an Android device except the external-model head-scale option, which was not tested. S4 GPU readback and the dependent S5 mesh cap remain blocked by their API contract; the user report does not establish those paths as validated. See the [execution record](docs/CAMERA_FIRST_PERSON_EXECUTION.md).
