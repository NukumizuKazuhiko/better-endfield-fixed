// The panel's command channel to the desktop modules, as those modules see it.
//
// Same arrangement as the virtual-key latch beside this header: the desktop
// sources are compiled unchanged, so whatever the Android host has to offer them
// arrives through the compatibility <Windows.h> chain. The implementation
// forwards to the runtime command pump
// (android/app/src/main/cpp/core/command_pump.cpp), which the settings app feeds
// through the framework's remote file space and the game process relays.
//
// Windows has no such channel: there the configuration is read once, from the
// environment, and every caller keeps its `#if !defined(_WIN32)` branch.
